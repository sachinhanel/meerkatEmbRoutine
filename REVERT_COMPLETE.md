# Revert Complete: Back to Original CommProtocol

## What Was Reverted

All hybrid protocol integration changes have been removed. The firmware is now back to the original state using the byte-stuffed `CommProtocol` with FreeRTOS tasks.

### Files Restored to Git State
- `src/main.cpp` - Back to original FreeRTOS structure
- `src/config.h` - Back to original configuration
- `src/CommProtocol.cpp` - Restored original byte-stuffed protocol
- `src/CommProtocol.h` - Restored original header

### Files Deleted
- `src/hybrid_protocol.cpp` - Removed
- `src/hybrid_protocol.h` - Removed
- `src/HybridCommProtocol.cpp` - Removed
- `src/HybridCommProtocol.h` - Removed
- `src/minimal_protocol.cpp` - Removed
- `src/minimal_protocol.h` - Removed
- All hybrid protocol documentation files - Removed

### Test Files Kept (Untracked)
- `test/hybrid_protocol_tester.py` - Kept for reference
- `test/minimal_protocol_tester.py` - Kept for reference
- `test/protocol_stuffed.py` - Kept for reference
- `test/test_sender.py` - Kept for reference

## Current State

You are now running the **original CommProtocol** (byte-stuffed protocol) with FreeRTOS tasks:

### Task Structure
```cpp
communicationTask (priority 3)
  - Processes CommProtocol commands
  - Handles autonomous polling

dataCollectionTask (priority 2)
  - Updates sensors
  - Maintains DataCollector state

mainLoopTask (priority 1)
  - General housekeeping
```

### Protocol
- Uses byte-stuffed framing: `[0xAA 0x55][PID][LEN][stuffed_payload][CHK][0x55 0xAA]`
- `CommProtocol::process()` handles incoming commands
- `CommProtocol::sendPeripheralData()` sends responses

---

## Why We Reverted

The hybrid protocol integration with FreeRTOS was causing severe reliability issues:

1. **Integration Complexity**: Adding the hybrid protocol on top of existing FreeRTOS structure introduced too many variables
2. **Inconsistent Results**: Tests became "really inconsistent and not working" after integration
3. **Unknown Root Cause**: We couldn't isolate whether the problem was:
   - Threading architecture
   - Hybrid protocol implementation
   - Serial communication timing
   - Task priorities/mutex contention

**Decision**: Revert to last known working state to establish a stable baseline.

---

## Next Steps - Systematic Debugging

Now that we're back to the original code, let's systematically identify the real problem:

### Step 1: Test Original Protocol (Baseline)
First, verify the original byte-stuffed protocol still works as expected:

```bash
# Build and upload current firmware (byte-stuffed protocol)
pio run -t upload

# Test with existing Python client
python test/test_sender.py  # or whatever client you were using before
```

**Expected Result**: Should work reliably (this was your working state before we started experimenting)

---

### Step 2: Identify the ACTUAL Problem

You mentioned tests were inconsistent. Let's narrow down WHAT specifically was failing:

**Question 1**: Was the original byte-stuffed protocol working reliably before we started adding hybrid protocol?
- If YES: Then the threading was fine, and we just need to understand why hybrid protocol integration broke it
- If NO: Then there's a fundamental issue with the current architecture that we need to fix first

**Question 2**: What are your test requirements?
- High reliability? (99%+ success rate)
- High throughput? (messages/second)
- Low latency? (response time)
- All of the above?

**Question 3**: What specific symptoms were you seeing?
- Timeouts waiting for responses?
- Corrupted data?
- ESP32 hanging/freezing?
- Intermittent connection drops?

---

### Step 3: If Original Protocol Works - Understand Why Hybrid Failed

If the original protocol works fine, then the hybrid protocol integration issue was likely:

**Option A: Serial Port Contention**
- Multiple tasks trying to write to Serial simultaneously
- Need proper mutex protection for `Serial.write()`

**Option B: Buffer Overflow**
- Hybrid protocol frames are longer (hex encoding doubles size)
- ESP32 Serial buffer (default 256 bytes) may overflow
- Solution: `Serial.setRxBufferSize(1024);`

**Option C: Timing Issues**
- Hybrid protocol uses newline-based framing (`readline()`)
- Different timing behavior than byte-stuffed protocol
- May need different task delays

**Option D: State Machine Conflicts**
- Hybrid protocol state machine (static variables) doesn't work well with FreeRTOS tasks
- Need proper thread-local storage or different architecture

---

### Step 4: If Original Protocol ALSO Fails - Fix Threading First

If the original byte-stuffed protocol is also unreliable, then the threading architecture needs work:

**Common FreeRTOS Issues:**

1. **Task Stack Overflow**
   ```cpp
   // Current: 4096 bytes per task
   xTaskCreate(communicationTask, "Communication", 4096, nullptr, 3, ...);

   // Try: 8192 bytes
   xTaskCreate(communicationTask, "Communication", 8192, nullptr, 3, ...);
   ```

2. **Watchdog Timer Issues**
   - Tasks taking too long without yielding
   - Need more `vTaskDelay()` calls

3. **Priority Inversion**
   - High priority task waiting on low priority task's mutex
   - Need proper mutex timeout values

4. **Serial Buffer Overflow**
   - Default ESP32 Serial buffer is only 256 bytes
   - Increase with `Serial.setRxBufferSize(1024);` in setup()

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Establish Baseline (NOW)
1. âœ… **DONE**: Reverted to original code
2. **TODO**: Test original byte-stuffed protocol
3. **TODO**: Document baseline performance (success rate, throughput, symptoms)

### Phase 2: Fix Any Existing Issues
1. If original protocol fails â†’ Fix threading/serial issues first
2. If original protocol works â†’ Proceed to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Add Hybrid Protocol WITHOUT FreeRTOS (If Needed)
1. Test hybrid protocol in standalone mode FIRST (we know this worked at 61 tests/s)
2. Create minimal reproduction test case
3. Verify reliability in standalone mode

### Phase 4: Integrate Hybrid Protocol Carefully
1. Add one change at a time
2. Test after each change
3. When it breaks, you know exactly what caused it

### Phase 5: Optimize Threading (If Required)
1. Only add threading when SPI peripherals actually require it
2. Consider simpler architecture (single loop + cooperative multitasking)
3. Use non-blocking I/O everywhere

## Questions for You

Before we proceed, please answer:

1. **Was the original byte-stuffed protocol working reliably before we started experimenting?**
   - This tells us if threading was ever stable

2. **What specific test failures were you seeing?**
   - Helps identify root cause (timeouts? corruption? hangs?)

3. **Do you need threading RIGHT NOW, or can we simplify to single loop?**
   - If you don't have real SPI peripherals yet, threading might be premature

4. **What's your priority?**
   - Get reliable communication working (even if slower)
   - Maximize throughput/speed
   - Prepare for future SPI peripheral integration

Once you answer these, we can proceed with the right debugging approach!
